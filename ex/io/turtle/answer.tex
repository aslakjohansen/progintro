The following solution is based on a very simple language. There is a command to take one step in each direction (north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west), a command to enable drawing and another to disable drawing. The sequence of commands needed to draw the image is thus relatively long:
\verbatiminput{\context/answer/house.turtle}

\inputminted{csharp}{\context/answer/Canvas.cs}
\inputminted{csharp}{\context/answer/Turtle.cs}
