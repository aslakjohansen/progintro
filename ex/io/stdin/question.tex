Write a program that waits for the user to enter some text, and then prints this text in reverse order, so that \say{\texttt{hello}} becomes \say{\texttt{olleh}}.

\textbf{Note:} This is a surprisingly difficult problem to solve, and an even more difficult problem to understand. The problem here is that while it is easy to access a specific \typename{char} in a \typename{string}, it is complicated to find out how many \typename{char} values ​​make up a character; and the typical interpretation of the problem works at the character level. If you want a correct implementation of the reverse order, see here: \url{https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reverse_a_string}. However, this is not a key element of the problem.
