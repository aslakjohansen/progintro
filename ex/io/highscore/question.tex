Many games maintain a list of \textsl{highscores}.

Describe abstractly -- for the purpose of implementing this -- which data structure should be used to implement such a list.

Next, create a class that implements a set of highscores:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A class named \typename{Highscores}.
  \item This class has a constructor that takes a file name as an argument.
  \item This class has a \methodname{Load} and a \methodname{Save} method that does what you expect them to do.
  \item This class has a \methodname{NewScore} method that should be called every time a game is finished.
  \item This class also has methods to extract the relevant information.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, create a program that tests this class.
