Using recursion, implement a function (in a module) in Elixir that, given two lists (\varname{a} and \varname{b}), produces a list whose $i$th element is a boolean value that is true if the $i$th element of \varname{a} is equal to the $i$th element of \varname{b}.

\textbf{Note:} In this exercise we assume that the lists in \varname{a} and \varname{b} are of equal length.
