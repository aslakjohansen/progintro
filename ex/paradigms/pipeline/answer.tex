\textbf{Subtask 2}

The higher order functions are actually implemented via recursion, but we don't see that at this level of abstraction.

\textbf{Subtask 3}

In subtask 1, the recursion is separated from the update of the best value. This is a good thing as it makes the code faster to navigate.

In subtask 2, it is clear what role each line has, and there are very few of them. This is Aslak's favorite.
