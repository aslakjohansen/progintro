Let's consider the following C\# program:
\inputminted[fontsize=\small]{csharp}{\context/question/Program.cs}

It defines a variety of people, and implements a function to calculate the age of the youngest male who is 18 or older.

The Elixir equivalent of the struct definition and input data looks like this:
\inputminted[fontsize=\small]{elixir}{\context/question/elixirequiv.exs}

\textbf{Subtask 1}

Use recursion to implement code in Elixir via Livebook that is functionally equivalent to the C\# function.

\textbf{Subtask 2}

Now instead use higher-order functions from the standard library\footnote{For example, those from the \modulename{Enum} and \modulename{List} modules.} to implement functionally equivalent code in Elixir via Livebook.

\textbf{Subtask 3}

Discuss which implementation is better and why?
