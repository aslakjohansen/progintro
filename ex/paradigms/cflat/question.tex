This exercise deals with the language C$\flat$ (pronounced C flat). This (programming) language is characterized by being remarkably similar to the first C\# you wrote.

At \url{https://github.com/aslakjohansen/cflat/blob/main/examples/cflat_demo.livemd} you will find a demo. Open this in Livebook, either by downloading the file, or by checking out the repository.

\textbf{Subtask 1}

In this exercise, you must paste a few of your solutions to the exercises from before you learned about arrays into the text field in this notebook, and then click through the remaining cells. Discuss why the abstract syntax tree looks the way it does.

\textbf{Subtask 2}

Now go to the above repository and find the code for the interpreter\footnote{\url{https://github.com/aslakjohansen/cflat/blob/main/lib/cflat/interpreter.ex}}. How is a \keywordname{while} loop evaluated?
