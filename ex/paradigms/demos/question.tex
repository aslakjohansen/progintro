First, you need to check out the following repository: \url{https://github.com/aslakjohansen/livebook-demos}. It contains some demo code that can be run through Livebook.

The exercise is to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open your installation of Livebook in a browser.
  \item Click \say{Open} and select \filename{index.livemd} from your checkout of the above repository.
  \item Hover your mouse over the bottom cell and click \say{Evaluate}. What you see is an index of the demos available in this repository. You can open these in new tabs.
  \item Spend some time (e.g. 15 min) clicking through the following demos:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basic data types
      \item Control structures
      \item Pattern matching
      \item Pipelines
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
