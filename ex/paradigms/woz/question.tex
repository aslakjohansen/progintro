  \item How does the \texttt{go} command work, and what determines where you can \textsl{go}?
  \item Try opening a new tab in your browser, and point it to exactly the same URL. Scroll down to the bottom and choose a new name. What is needed for the two users to talk to each other, and how is this implemented?
