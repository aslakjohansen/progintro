The error occurs when \varname{points} has the value $50$. Then both conditions will evaluate to \texttt{true} and this will cause both branches to be evaluated with the text \say{\texttt{You PASSEDFAILED!}} as a result.

The error is due to an ambiguity about whether 50 points is passed or failed. Once this ambiguity is resolved, one of the conditions can be fixed. Although this will result in correct code, it still has a significant weakness: two independent branches are used in the code for an either-or situation. This means that correctness over time depends on a programmer updating both conditions correctly when the limit changes from 50 to something else (e.g., 40). A better solution would be to have a single condition in an \textsl{if-then-else} construction. This effectively defines the second block to be evaluated in every case where the first one is not evaluated. Thus, it is guaranteed that exactly one of the blocks is evaluated.
