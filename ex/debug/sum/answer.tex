The \methodname{sum} method contains three bugs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The method operates on indices instead of the elements that are at the index positions in \varname{numbers}.
  \item The \keywordname{for}-loop condition is off-by-one such that the method goes one step too far. This results in an \texttt{IndexOutOfRangeException}.
  \item The loop variable \varname{i} starts with the value 1, which means that the first element in \varname{numbers} is skipped. The calculated result is therefore the value of \texttt{\varname{numbers}[0]} too low.
\end{enumerate}

These errors are fixed in the following code:
