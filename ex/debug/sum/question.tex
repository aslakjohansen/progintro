In the following program, there is a \methodname{Sum} method that is written to sum up the values of a series of numbers. The program also has a \methodname{Main} method that defines two test cases and prints the result of calling \methodname{Sum} on each of them. However, it seems that \methodname{Sum} is not written correctly. Can you figure out what is wrong and fix the code?
