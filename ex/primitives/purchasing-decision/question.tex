Consider the following code:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
double price = 599.95;
double budget = 1000.0;
bool requiredReading = true;
bool shouldBuy = price < budget && requiredReading;
\end{minted}

Explain the last line, and focus on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In which order is what calculated?
  \item Which values (named and otherwise) are each operator evaluated on?
  \item What are the types of these values?
  \item What does the variable \varname{shouldBuy} represent?
\end{itemize}
