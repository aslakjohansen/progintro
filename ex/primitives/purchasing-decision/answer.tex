The calculation is done according to the \idx{parse tree}{Tree!Parse}:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[]
    \newcommand{\dist}[0]{15mm}
    
    \tikzstyle{node} = [
      rectangle,
      draw=black,

    \draw[dedge] (requiredreading)->(and);
    \draw[dedge] (and)->(shouldbuy);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The variable \varname{shouldBuy} represents the outcome of the decision of whether to purchase a book. The book should be purchased when then price is below budget, and the book is required reading.
