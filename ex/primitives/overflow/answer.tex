In \csharp, there are 4 (primitive, signed and portable) integral types: \typename{sbyte}, \typename{short}, \typename{int} and \typename{long}.

An \typename{sbyte} can represent any integral number from (and including) -128 until (and also including) 127. To find out what happens when we exceed the largest number it can represent, we writw the following program:

\inputminted{csharp}{\context/answer/IntegerBoundary.cs}

When executed, it prints:

\begin{verbatim}
127
-128
\end{verbatim}

Accordingly, $127+1$ turns out to evaluate to $-128$. In other words; when we add one to the largest number we an represent we get the lowest number we can represent. This is not a coincidence, and holds for all the primitive integer types.
