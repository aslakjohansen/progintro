Consider the following program:

\inputminted{csharp}{\context/question/AvgAge.cs}

Execute the program and explain what happens?

Write an english text (or one in any human language for that matter) where you, through technical terms describe what happens. Make sure that this text is detailed enough for another programmer to reconstruct the original code (or equivalent).
