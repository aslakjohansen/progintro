Expressions and statements are different syntactic constructs. The \csharp\ compiler expects expressions at some places in the code and statements at other. If your program does not adhere to these \textsl{rules} then the compiler will give a syntax error and give up.

The most important difference is that an expression -- as opposed to a statement -- evaluates to a value. The main structure of logic is made up of statements, and expressions are used to describe intermediate results within specific statements.
