A \typename{boolean} can either refer to a type, or a variable of this type. In the latter case, the variable can have one of two values; namely true and false. This is a single bit of information, but is typically assigned more memory than that. A number of \textsl{boolean} operators are defined on this type. They are used to implement \idx{boolean logic}{Logic!Boolean}.
