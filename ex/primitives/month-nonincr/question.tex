Write a program in which:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An integer variable is declared.
  \item Assign a value to this variable that represents a month (i.e., 2 is February).
  \item Print out the value of the variable.
  \item Increase the value of this variable by 0.5.
  \item Print out the value of the variable.
  \item Increase the value of this variable by 0.5.
  \item Print out the value of the variable.
\end{enumerate}

Make the necessary adjustments to make the program compile by casting to \typename{int}, run it, and describe what you observe.

Explain the printouts you observe.
