\textbf{Observation:} I used 9 as the initial value. This value did not change as I added 0.5, and still remained the same as I did it again.

\textbf{Explanation:} When adding values of different types, C\# performs a conversion to the type on the right-hand side of the operator. As this type is integral, the value 0.5 will be rounded to zero. So, in reality we are adding zero to nine \ldots twice.
