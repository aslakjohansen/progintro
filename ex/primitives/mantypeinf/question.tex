Assume that the follow line of code compiles cleanly (no warnings or errors):

\begin{minted}{csharp}
// this line contains a declaration of a
int b = a + 1;
\end{minted}

What can you tell about the type that \varname{a} is declared as?

More specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Does this mean that \varname{a} is an integer?
  \item Would the code compile if \varname{a} is a non-numeric datatype?
  \item Would the code compile if \varname{a} is a numeric datatype other than \typename{int}? Which ones?
\end{itemize}
