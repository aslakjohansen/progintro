A variable is a symbolic reference (or indirection) to a value. We say that the variable \textsl{refers} to the value. We can change which value the variable refers to by assigning it a new value. In reality the value is placed either in the computers memory, or a register. The variable will refer to this location (memory address or register number).

This is an abstraction that makes it possible to write code that is independent of specific values.
