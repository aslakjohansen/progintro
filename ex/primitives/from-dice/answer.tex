\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{dice \& 1}: This expression is a bitwise AND operation between \varname{dice} and \texttt{1}. If \varname{dice} is even then the result will be zero (as the least significant bit of an even number is zero).
  \item \texttt{dice > 3}: This expression checks wheter the value of \varname{dice} is larger than three.
\end{itemize}
