Write a program in which:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A Celcius temperature is assigned to a variable.
  \item This temperature is converted to degree Fahrenheit and stored in another variable.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Formula: $T_F = 32+\frac{9}{5} T_C$
    \end{itemize}
  \item Print out the conversion in a reasonable way.
\end{enumerate}
