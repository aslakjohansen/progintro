There are 12 different months. Often 1 is said to represent January \ldots\ It is unclear what 1.1 would mean then, so limiting ourselves to integral values we can make sure that we never have to find out. For a similar reason, we might as well look at the \textsl{unsigned} variants. As we only have 12 months, an \typename{int} is more space efficient than a \typename{long}. An \typename{sbyte} is even smaller (and has no problem representing 12 values). It is, however, slower to work with on modern computers.
