We are always allowed to cast explicitly, but this is considered a bad practice as it is unnecessary and distracting. The following code shows the minimal amount of explicit casting:

\inputminted{csharp}{\context/answer/Casting.cs}

As the typechecker executes at compiletime it (generally) cannot take concrete values into account. It thus has to work at the type-level, and act according to a worst-case scenario.

There is no guarantee that a \typename{long} value can \textsl{fit} into the smaller size of an \typename{int} variable, or similarly, that a \typename{double} value can fit into a \typename{float} variable. Naturally, a floating point number cannot fit into an integer number.

The rule is that an explicit cast is necessary if the operation has the potential to result in a loss of data.
