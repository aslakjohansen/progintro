Write a program that has 7 hardcoded daily temperatures. It should calculate and print out the temperature of all consecutive days (i.e., Tuesday-Monday, Wednesday-Tuesday \ldots Sunday-Saturday).

The daily temperatures could be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Monday: 21.5
  \item Tuesday: 23.7
  \item Wednesday: 19.6
  \item Thursday: 22.5
  \item Friday: 25.3
  \item Saturday: 21.7
  \item Sunday: 18.9
\end{itemize}

Then, the result would be:
\begin{verbatim}
2.1999999999999993
-4.099999999999998
2.8999999999999986
2.8000000000000007
-3.6000000000000014
-2.8000000000000007
\end{verbatim}

Why is the result wrong?
