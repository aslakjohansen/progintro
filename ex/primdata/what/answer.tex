An array is a \textsl{datastruktur} in which a static number of elements are placed contiguously in memory. Lookups are efficient as all elements have the same size. Behind the scene \csharp\ does something like this:

\begin{eqnarray}
  A_{\mathrm{element}} = A_{\mathrm{array}} + \mathrm{index}*\mathbf{sizeof}(\mathbf{typeof}(\mathrm{element}))
\end{eqnarray}
