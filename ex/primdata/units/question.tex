In this exercise we will be working with different units of distance. Our program will have an input value (measured in meters), and we want to convert it to some unit as specified through another variable.

\textbf{Subtask 1}

What should we call that other variable, and what would be a reasonable type for it?

We want to be able to represent the units m, cm, mm and inches.

\textbf{Subtask 2}

Next, we need a way mapping the unit some expression that converts between the meters of the input and the output unit. For distances, this is simply a factor.

\textbf{Subtask 3}

Write code that defines the type from subtask 1, implements the mapping functionality from subtask 2, and uses this to convert an input value of 1.234 meters to mm.
