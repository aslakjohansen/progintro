When we create an array without explicitly defining its contents, we need to tell \csharp how large this array needs to be. Otherwise, how could it know how much memory to allocate? In \csharp, this is one using an expression that must evaluate to an integer. This means that the size can be expressed using a constant value, the contents of a variable, or the result of a calculation.
