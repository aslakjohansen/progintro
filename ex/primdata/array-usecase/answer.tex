Arrays solves the problem where all integers under a certain number need to be associated (or \idx{mapped}{Mapping}) to an individual value.

A common variant of this scenario is that all integers \textsl{between} to numbers need to be mapped to an individual value. Here, one often chooses to shift all elements by subtracting the index of the lower bound from all index operations. This way, we are not wasting memory. It will become a bit more expensive (in terms of time) to use the array though. This is a \idx{tradeoff}{Tradeoff}.
