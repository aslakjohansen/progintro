Write a program that has 7 hardcoded daily temperatures. It should calculate and print out the temperature of all consecutive days (i.e., Tuesday-Monday, Wednesday-Tuesday \ldots Sunday-Saturday).

The daily temperatures could be:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Monday: 21.5
  \item Tuesday: 23.7
  \item Wednesday: 19.6
  \item Thursday: 22.5
  \item Friday: 25.3
  \item Saturday: 21.7
  \item Sunday: 18.9
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notice:} This is a repetition of exercise \ref{q:primitives:weekly-temp-diff}, but this time you have a larger toolbox at your disposal.
