Write a program in which
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A datastructure is created to hold the calendar of a single year. One needs to be able to index it using a date (month and day) in order to extract which weekday it is (e.g., Monday).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What is the type of this data structure?
      \item How do you initialize a variable of this type?
      \item How can you make sure that the contents is correct?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Print out the contents of this data structure in a \say{nice} way.
\end{enumerate}
