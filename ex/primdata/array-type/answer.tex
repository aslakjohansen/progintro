All elements in an array must have the same type. For instance, if one wishes to place data of the type \typename{int} inside an array, then that array must have the type \typename{int[]}. Otherwise, you will get a compile.

\textbf{Note:} Later in this book, we will see how we -- to some extend -- can work around this rule by using object-oriented constructs (not that this ability is unique to object-oriented languages).
