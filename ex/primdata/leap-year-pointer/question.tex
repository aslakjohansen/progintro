Write a program in which
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A variable is initialized to be an array containing the number of days in each of the 12 months in a normal year. The first element will then contain the number of days in January.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What should the type of this array be?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Another variable is initialized to be an array containing the number of days in each of the 12 months in a leap year.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What should the type of this array be?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Iterate through the years 2000 through 2020:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Use a new variable called \varname{pointer} to refer to the array that matches the year from the iteration.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item What should the type of this variable be?
          \item How much data is copied here?
          \item \textbf{Hint:} You can simplify the leap year rules so that any year divisible by four is a leap year.
        \end{itemize}
      \item For every year, the contents of the array referenced by \varname{pointer} is printed to the screen.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
