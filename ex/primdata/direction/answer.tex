Because we write code in English a good name for type would be \typename{Direction}. Convention dictations that the first letter should be capitalized. Even though there are multiple directions, we use the singular form of the noun.

Similar rules apply for the naming of the individual values. One could consider shortening the directions to \texttt{N}, \texttt{S}, \texttt{E}, and \texttt{W}. That, however, would also make it harder to interpret the code.
