Write a program that calculates all primes below 1,000,000 and prints out the largest.

Do this by implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes}}.

The square root of \texttt{i} is calculated as \methodname{Math.Sqrt(i)}.

\textbf{Note:} This is a progression of exercise \ref{q:flow:primes}. Here, you will find a definition of what a prime number is.
