Write a program in which
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An integer variable named \varname{size} is declared and initialized to some value under 30. You pick the concrete value.
  \item An array is created with a length that matches the value of \varname{size}.
  \item This array is filled up with the 3 table. That is, an element at index $n$ must have the value $3 \cdot n$.
  \item Print out one or more elements to verify the correctness of what you have done. How do you pick which elements to observe in such a way that you gain a lot of value from these observations while limiting the number of observations?
\end{enumerate}
