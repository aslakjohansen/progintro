Ma mathematical function is a really good match for a function in \csharp. The big difference is that \csharp functions -- unlike mathematical functions -- can have side-effects. They can access state (in memory). Through variables, they read read from and write to the main memory of the computer. This allows them to express behavior that depends on the state of that memory.
