Write a program that calculates and prints out both the area  ($\pi \cdot r^2$) and circumference ($2 \cdot \pi \cdot r$) of three circles with radii of 1, 3 and 5.

\textbf{Note:} This is essentially a repetition of \ref{q:primdata:area-of-circles}, but this time you have a larger (and more applicable) toolbox at your disposal.
