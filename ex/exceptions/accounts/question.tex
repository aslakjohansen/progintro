Consider the following code:

\inputminted[fontsize=\small]{csharp}{\context/question/Accounts.cs}

The function \methodname{Convert.ToInt32} converts the \typename{string} returned by \methodname{Console.ReadLine} to an \typename{int}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What happens if you give the program \say{3} as input?
  \item Make a variant of the program that uses exception handling in the \texttt{while} loop to make the program more robust to this input.
  \item What happens if you give the program \say{to} as input?
  \item Make a variant of the program that uses exception handling to make the program more robust to this input. Where is the right place to add this exception handling?
\end{enumerate}
