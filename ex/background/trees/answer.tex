\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{a} has a cycle and is thus not a tree.
  \descitem{b} is connected, and has $n=9$ nodes and exactly $n-1$ unique edges. It is thus a tree.
  \descitem{c} is connected, and has $n=6$ nodes and exactly $n-1$ unique edges. It is thus a tree.
  \descitem{d} is connected, and has $n=7$ nodes and exactly $n-1$ unique edges. It is thus a tree.
  \descitem{e} is connected, and has $n=9$ nodes and $9$ unique edges (i.e., $\neq n-1$). It is thus not a tree.
  \descitem{f} consists of two subgraphs which each is a tree. A graph that consists of all trees is called a \defix{forest}{Forest}.
\end{itemize}
