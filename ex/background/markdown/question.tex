In the root of your local clone of the \texttt{progintro-exercises} repository, create a file called \filename{README.md} using your text editor. Make sure the contents of the file looks like this:

\begin{minted}[breaklines,fontsize=\tiny]{markdown}

This is a \idx{markdown}{Markdown} file. Markdown is an example of a \idx{markup}{Markup language}. That means that it can give textual elements simple typographical properties.
