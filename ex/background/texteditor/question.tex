In this exercise, you will have to install a text editor on your computer. This is a program that edit the characters in a file. There are lots of options, and the choice is not particularly important.

The only thing that matters is that it is \textsl{not} an IDE. That is, you must not have access to features such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Automatic code completion (e.g., IntelliSense).
  \item A debugger.
  \item Index of variables and other names.
  \item Built-in generative AI.
  \item Built-in suggestion engine.
\end{itemize}

If you already have experience with \commandname{vi} or \commandname{emacs}, you are all good. If not, then you should avoid them at this point in time as their learning curve is quite steep.

Here are some options (ask your instructor for more):

\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Windows}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Kate (without LSP)
    \end{itemize}
  \descitem{OSX}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Kate (without LSP)
    \end{itemize}
  \descitem{Linux}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Zed (install \csharp extension and turn most options off)
      \item Gedit
      \item Kate (without LSP)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

So, you need to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pick one of the above text editors.
  \item Figure out how it should be installed. This may require some googling.
  \item Install it.
\end{itemize}
