In this exercise, you will install the GIT command line tool. The process is different for each of the major operating systems.

\subsubsection{Linux}

As a Linux user you should be able to figure this out by yourself. But on a Debian-based system (e.g., Ubuntu) the following command (when executed as a privileged user) will do the trick:

\begin{minted}{shell}
apt-get install git-all
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{OSX}

Follow the instructions on github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/git-guides/install-git\#install-git-from-an-installer}}.

\subsubsection{Windows}

As we are using a Debian-based WSL in this book, you should open a WSL shell and follow the instructions for Linux.
