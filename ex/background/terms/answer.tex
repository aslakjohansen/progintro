\begin{enumerate}
  \item This is a directed and weighted graph.
  \item There are nine nodes.
  \item There are 11 edges.
  \item $n_9$, $n_8$, $n_5$ and $n_6$ make a graph of 4 edges.
  \item Due to the direction of the edge from $n_2$ to $n_9$, there is no path from $n_8$ to $n_4$. Had this path been reversed, the total distance would be $1.4+1.6+2.4+1.5+1.3=8.2$.
\end{enumerate}
