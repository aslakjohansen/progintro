\begin{itemize}
  \descitem{Autumn Holiday} October
  \descitem{Christmas Holiday} December
  \descitem{Spring Holiday} April
  \descitem{Summer Holiday} July + August
\end{itemize}

Write a program in which:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A month is given in the form of an integer via a variable.
  \item Depending on the value of this variable, either print out the name of the holiday (if there is a holiday in the month), or simply \say{Hard work} (if there isn't).
\end{enumerate}
