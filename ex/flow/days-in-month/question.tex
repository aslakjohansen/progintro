Write a program in which:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A number of a month is stored in a variable. This variable acts as input to your program.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Which name would be appropriate for this variable?
      \item Which type would be appropriate for this variable?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Write some code that determines how many days there is in the input month (lets assume no leap year).
  \item Prints out the result.
\end{enumerate}

Use a calendar to verify that your implementation is correct.
