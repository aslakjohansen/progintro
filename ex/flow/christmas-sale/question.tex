Write a program in which:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A variable is declared and initialized to the value 21816000. This value represents a number of seconds since newyear (assuming that all months are 30 days long).
  \item Some other variable represents a price and has a value of 599.95.
  \item If it is Christmas, there is a 30\% rebate. Find a reasonable way of determining when it is Christmas.
  \item Calculate the current price (including any rebate) and store this in a third variable.
  \item Print out the value of this variable.
\end{enumerate}

Be sure to test the logic you have written be assigning the first variable different values. Which values would be relevant to test?
