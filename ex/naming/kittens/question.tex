Write a program in which:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a \classname{Kitten} class.
    \item Objects of this type have a \varname{cuteness} attribute of type \typename{double} that is initialized through a constructor.
    \item A class variable (aka a \textsl{static} variable) named \varname{count} of type \typename{int} that is initialized to $0$, and incremented every time a kitten is constructed.
    \item Add a \methodname{Main} method that -- via a \texttt{for}-loop -- constructs a number of \typename{Kitten} objects with varying \varname{cuteness}, and then finally prints out the value of \varname{count}.
    \item Execute the program and verify that \varname{count} has the expected value.
\end{itemize}
