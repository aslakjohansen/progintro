When we call \methodname{Solve} with an \typename{int} and a \typename{double} that will result in the compiler looking for an implementation of this method with a signature that matches \methodname{Solve} $\times$ \typename{int} $\times$ \typename{double}. As this does not exist, then compilation will fail.
