Build and execute the following program:

\inputminted{csharp}{\context/question/OperatorTest.cs}

Consider the output (i.e., what is printed to the screen), and explain what is going on. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Which operators are evaluated on the individual lines? Or, in other words, what does \texttt{(?1?)}, \texttt{(?2?)}, \texttt{(?3?)}, \texttt{(?4?)} and \texttt{(?5?)} represent?
  \item How do these relate to the 3rd argument to the \methodname{Operator} calls?
  \item What is the important part of that 3rd parameter? Which rule is being exploited?
  \item Is this a reasonable interface for \methodname{Operator}?
\end{enumerate}
