\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Sūdoku}

Write a program that solves a puzzle.

This is -- so far -- the final exercise in our \idx{Sūdoku}{Sūdoku} series. This series consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A puzzle representation in exercise \ref{q:primdata:sudoku-puzzle}.
  \item A \idx{pretty-printer}{Pretty printing} in exercise \ref{q:functions:sudoku-print}.
  \item A checker in exercise \ref{q:primdata:sudoku-check}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game of Life}

Make an implementation of \idx{John Comway}{Conway!John}'s \idx{Game of Life}{Game of Life}. You can find a description of this simulation on \idx{Wikipedia}{Wikipedia}.

\textbf{Note:} A few hints:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Illustrate each generation using characters (e.g., a space for no life and an asterisk for life).
  \item Pick a world size that fits on your screen.
  \item Insert a pause in between each generation.
  \item Initialize your world randomly
\end{itemize}

We have not quite covered everything needed to do follow these hints. The missing pieces, you can derive experimentally from this code:

\begin{minted}{csharp}
Random r = new Random();

while (true) {
  Console.WriteLine(r.Next(2));
  Thread.Sleep(1000);
}
\end{minted}
