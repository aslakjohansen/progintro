\chapter{Abstract Methods}

% definition: collection of methods

% example: Lockable
For instance, many things can be locked and unlocked. These things are \textsl{lockable}, and that is a quality that we might want to associate with both buildings and vehicles. We can use an interface to group two methods that define this behavior; one that locks, and one that unlocks.

% can be used as a type

% contract across the type

% Check: in order to satisfy an interface type, an instantiable type must have implementations for those methods

\subsubsection{Naming Convention}

It is convention, in \csharp, to prefix the name of an interface with a capital \interfacename{I}. The interface defining the \textsl{lockable} behavior should thus be called \interfacename{ILockable}. This convention is not enforced.
