“In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements.  Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer’s shifting idea of what their problem is.”
-- Jeff Atwood

“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it.”
-- Brian Kernighan

“A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila.”
-- Mitch Radcliffe
   
“It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.” 
-- John Von Neumann, circa 1949

“If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside.”
-- Robert X. Cringely

“The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.”
-- Edsger W. Dijkstra

“Never trust a computer you can’t throw out a window.”
-- Steve Wozniak

“I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means.  It means we get to keep all our old mistakes.”
-- Dennie van Tassel

“The Internet?  Is that thing still around?”
-- Homer Simpson

“The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry.”
-- Henry Petroski

“Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.”
-- Brian Kernigan
 
“There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.”
-- C.A.R. Hoare

“Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots.  So far the Universe is winning.”
-- Rich Cook

“Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.”
-- Larry Wall

“The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late.”
-- Seymour Cray 

“A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more.”
-- Peter Seebach

“The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones.  They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability.”
-- Randall E. Stross

“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.”
-- Bill Gates

“First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.”
-- John Johnson

“To iterate is human, to recurse divine.”
-- L. Peter Deutsch

“The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit.”
-- Anonymous

“Should array indices start at 0 or 1?  My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.”
-- Stan Kelly-Bootle

“The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague.”
-- Djikstra

“In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.”
-- Anonymous

“The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state.”
-- J. Osterhout

“Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.”
-- Edward V Berard

“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”
-- Martin Golding

“A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.”
-- Doug Linder

“If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.”
-- Gerald Weinberg
