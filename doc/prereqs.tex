% what is a text editor

% problem
While any text editor would do, not all are created equal. In particular, not all are equally suited for beginners. Some features help you think about the code, and understand it. Such features include syntax highlighting (the highlighting of different parts of the code according to their role), line highlighting and paranthesis highlighting. Other features aim to maximize the rate of code production. Such features typically allows you to be very \say{productive} without having to think a whole lot about the code. This has a tendency to lead to absent-mindedness and that is especially problematic when learning how to program. When working with the subject, you need to be present in mind and think about code. Always think about what makes it tick! Features that detracts from this are undesirable. These include anything that provides you with suggestions on how to write or rewrite your code. Any kind of autocomplete functionality -- be it rooted in generative AI or otherwise -- diverts your thought process from solving the problem proactively. That is bad. Other editors are very keen to suggest minor rewrites according to some set of more or less well-intended guidelines. However, these guidelines were rarely intended with novice developers in mind. In fact, then often hide complexity from the developer that is critical for the development of the novice developer.
