\subsubsection{Editing Files}

% what does it mean to edit a file?

% explain it
Figure \ref{fig:bg:processes:edit} illustrates how a typical text editor with work with a file. First the file is opened. Then, the contents of the file is read and written to main memory. The user may then manipulate the in-memory representation through some user interface, and saved the modified buffer (memory representation) to disk. Finally, the program will close the file.
