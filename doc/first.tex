  \quoted{When the first caveman programmer chiseled the first program on the walls of the first cave computer, it was a program to paint the string `Hello, world' in Antelope pictures. Roman programming textbooks began with the `Salut, Mundi' program. I don't know what happens to people who break with this tradition, but I think it's safer not to find out.}

\section{Phases}

% ahead-of-time compiled language, compilation phase results in a binary that is transferable (and portable) and can be executed without the precense of the compiler
\csharp is an ahead-of-time compiled language. This means that program execution is a step separate from program compilation. Or, to skip the technical terms, there is a compilation phase whereby a special program known as a compiler produces a program binary by processing the program source code. This binary is transferable and (fairly) portable. This means that it can be moved to a different machine and executed without the presence of a compiler. But lets take a step back a take a look of all the involved steps.
