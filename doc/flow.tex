\chapter{Flow Control}

% motivation
So far, we have worked with a strict sequence of \idx{statements}{Statement}. All of these statements are evaluated, in \idx{order}{Order}. This is a quality that we will often come to rely on. But it is not expressive enough. We need to introduce \idx{choice}{Choice} and \idx{repetition}{Repetition} to our vocabulary, and our toolbox. Figure \ref{fig:flow:types} illustrates the set of basic flow abstractions that we will cover in this chapter. It is up to the individual programmer to decide how to combine these in order to implement desired behavior.

% context evolution: sequence (derived from the last statement), whichever way we go through the "track" we will only have access to the declarations from the common "ancestors"
