Hello

\section{Intended Audience}

\section{Tenets}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The role of a course introducing programming is to create a technical foundation, not to please the industry. Ideally, students of such a course can -- in time -- bring positive change to the industry.
  \item Practice should be rooted in theory.
  \item The why is just as important as the how.
  \item Concepts are more important than concrete implementations.
  \item Concrete implementation choices can often be highlighted by contrasting to other implementations.
  \item Students should be able to look to educational material for good examples of how to write.
\end{enumerate}

% general: how we learn
People rarely decide to undertake the hardships of learning something because they want to go through the process of learning. They want have been through the process and know. It's the destination that pulls them in. As intelligent beings we subconsciously seek shortcuts, yet we are not particularly good at keeping the long-term goalpost present in mind. In order to absorb and understand the knowledge we need to be present along the way, observe the details and experience how they relate to each other. This applies to programming, perhaps more so than to most other fields.

% specific: this book positioned in your journey
This book is intended to help you in during the very first leg of your journey. As that is the first of many, focus will be on learning the basics rather than learning concrete tools and technologies that are used in the industry. At times these goals overlap, but more often than not they conflict. So, this book will not prepare you for the industry. That is a task you will have to deal with later on in your journey.

% specific: within this book

% your help needed
So, we need your help in achieving this. You do so by keeping a focus on the following across your studies:
\begin{enumerate}
  \descitem{Curiosity} 
  \descitem{Pride} 
  \descitem{Thoroughness} 
  \descitem{Effort} 
  \descitem{Communication} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Index}

Items are grouped so that in order to look up a \say{directed edge}, one first looks up \say{edge}, and then \say{directed} among the related entries. Page numbers with definitions are marked with bold.
