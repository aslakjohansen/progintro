\section{Intended Audience}

\section{Tenets}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The role of a course introducing programming is to create a technical foundation, not to please the industry. Ideally, students of such a course can -- in time -- bring possitive change to the industry.
  \item Practice should be rooted in theory.
  \item Concepts are more important than concrete implementations.
  \item Concrete implementation choices can often be highlighted by contrasting to other implementations.
  \item Students should be able to look to educational material for good examples of how to write.
\end{enumerate}
