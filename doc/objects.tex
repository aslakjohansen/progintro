% working with structs

% example: reference as parameter to functions associated with a struct

% the struct is a concext: one context for each object

\section{Syntactic Sugar}

% methods rather than functions

% the constructor

\section{The Static Confusion}

% one context shared between all objects

% why call it a class?

\section{Case: Matrices}

% motivation: matrices are used in many forms of programming, graphics examples
In this section we will briefly cover \idx{matrices}{Matrix}. There are a number of domains where the ability for us to work with matrices is crucial. While they don't provide us with new functionality, they do represent a convenient \idx{abstraction}{Abstraction}, and they certainly help speed up \idx{graphics}{Graphics} and \idx{graph}{Graph} calculations.

% matrix def: rectangular array of numbers, numbers are called entries of the matrix, conventions (m*n matrix A: element names)
So what are they? They are rectangular \idx{arrays}{Array} of numbers. Each of these numbers are called entries of the matrix. The size of a matrix is named after the size along each of the two dimensions: A $2 \times 3$ matrix has a height of $2$ and a width of $3$. If we name the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, then the entries are called:
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{A} =
  \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
      a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
    \end{matrix}
  \right]
\end{equation*}
So, the dimensions of a matrix are 1-indexed. Madness!
