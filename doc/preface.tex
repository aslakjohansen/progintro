% my background: classical (experimental) computer science, programming language tolerant, teaching object oriented programming (java and csharp) on a danish SE education, what is a danish SE education.
My background is from fairly classical (experimental) computer science, and has always been programming language tolerent. Today, I am teaching an introductionary programming course on a Danish software engineering education. That course has a focus on object-orientation. Previously, the it targeted Java, but we recently made the shift to \csharp.

% motivation: lack of introduction-level C# books that doesn't try to bypass the learning experience
